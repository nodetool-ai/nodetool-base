## 2024-05-19 - aiofiles module resolution gotcha
**Learning:** `aiofiles.os.path` does NOT exist as an async module hierarchy in `aiofiles`. `aiofiles.os.path` resolves to the synchronous standard library `os.path`. To use async path operations with `aiofiles`, you must import `aiofiles.ospath` and call `await aiofiles.ospath.exists()` and similar methods. Prefixing `aiofiles.os.path.exists()` with `await` evaluates to `await bool`, resulting in a runtime `TypeError` crash.
**Action:** When replacing blocking `os.path` operations, specifically use `aiofiles.ospath`. Do not string-replace `os.path.` with `aiofiles.os.path.`.

## 2024-05-20 - Optimize CSV File Load/Save Operations
**Learning:** Using `aiofiles.read()` and `.splitlines()` reads the entire file content into an in-memory string list before processing, causing a massive memory spike and significantly worse performance for large files.
**Action:** When reading or writing potentially large structured formats like CSVs, offload the streaming I/O logic using standard synchronous tools (e.g., `csv.DictReader` and `csv.DictWriter` inside a `with open(...)` block) to `asyncio.to_thread` instead of buffering massive strings asynchronously.

## 2024-05-20 - Non-blocking API calls with ApifyClient
**Learning:** Using the synchronous `ApifyClient` in async node methods like `process()` blocks the entire asyncio event loop while waiting for actors to complete and when iterating over paginated datasets (`list(dataset.iterate_items())`).
**Action:** When working with the Apify API in `nodetool` nodes, always use `ApifyClientAsync` and async comprehensions (`[item async for item in dataset.iterate_items()]`) to prevent event loop blocking and allow highly concurrent workflow execution.
