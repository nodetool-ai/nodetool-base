AI Product Launch Video Generator DSL Example

Create a realistic 16:9 marketing video for a new product launch using the TextToVideo node.

Workflow:
1. **Collect Campaign Inputs** - Marketing brief, audience, and tone
2. **Craft Video Prompt** - Assemble a cinematic prompt from structured inputs
3. **Generate Video** - Produce a high-definition clip with AI text-to-video
4. **Output Asset** - Save the generated video for review and editing

# Agent: Craft an optimized Sora prompt from structured inputs
# The agent follows widely-adopted video prompting best practices:
# - Concrete subject, scene, action, and context
# - Camera language (shot size, lens, movement), composition and depth cues
# - Lighting/time-of-day, color palette, atmosphere, and texture details
# - Motion cues and pacing, realism and physical plausibility
# - Concise constraints: no text/logos/watermarks, avoid glitches
# - Keep it under ~150 words in one paragraph, present tense

Using the marketing inputs, write an OpenAI Sora prompt for a single 16:9 product launch shot.

Rules:
- Do not specify resolution or duration in text (those are API parameters).
- Present tense, visually concrete; one clear camera move and one primary subject action.
- Include: subject, setting, time-of-day, camera language (framing, angle, lens, movement), composition cues, lighting, 3–5 color anchors, atmosphere/texture, and realistic motion cues.
- Emphasize the product and key features naturally within the scene for the target audience and tone.
- If useful, end with an optional Dialogue: block (short, natural lines) and/or Background Sound: line; otherwise omit.
- Finish with constraints: no on-screen text, no logos, no watermarks, no glitches, no distorted anatomy.

Inputs:
- Campaign brief: {{ brief }}
- Target audience: {{ audience }}
- Desired tone: {{ tone }}
- Key features: {{ features }}
