Audio Podcast Producer DSL Example

Professional podcast production workflow combining multiple audio tracks with
effects and level adjustment.

Workflow:
1. **Load Audio Files** - Load voice track, background music, intro/outro
2. **Adjust Intro/Outro** - Apply fade in/out effects for smooth transitions
3. **Mix Tracks** - Blend voice, music, and intros with volume balancing
4. **Save Output** - Export final podcast episode as audio file

This demonstrates:
- Multi-track audio mixing
- Effect processing (fade in/out)
- Volume level adjustment
- Audio file management
- Professional podcast production patterns
