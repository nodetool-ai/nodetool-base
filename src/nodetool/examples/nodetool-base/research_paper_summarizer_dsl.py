Title: Attention Is All You Need

Abstract:
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks.
We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms.

Introduction:
Recurrent neural networks have long been the standard for sequence modeling tasks.
However, RNNs suffer from parallelization challenges during training.
Our approach abandons recurrence entirely and relies on attention mechanisms.

Methods:
The Transformer architecture consists of:
1. Multi-head self-attention layers
2. Feed-forward networks
3. Positional encoding
4. Layer normalization

Results:
Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on machine translation tasks.
The architecture enables much faster training compared to RNNs.
We demonstrate superior performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion:
The Transformer architecture represents a major advancement in sequence modeling.
It enables faster training and better parallelization.
Future work will explore applications beyond sequence transduction.
